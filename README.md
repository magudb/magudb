Hi, I’m Magnus. I write code, set direction, and remove roadblocks so good people can build great products. These days I’m CTO at @TestaVivaDK
, where we turn legal complexity into a few clear clicks.

I’m happiest when learning in public—posting notes, small demos, and “here’s what failed” write-ups. Degrees in IT-Management and Social/Computer Science, but most of what I know comes from shipping, listening, and iterating.

Off the clock: coffees with Line, football with Frej, drawings with Liv.
